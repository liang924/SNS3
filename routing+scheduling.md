  Devices 
    02-06-00:00:00:00:00:17, sat: 1, beam: 30. Linked to GW 02-06-00:00:00:00:00:05
```
- UT 4 â†’ Connected via SAT 0, beam 43. Traffic is routed through GW (...:1a, belongs to SAT 1).
- UT 7 â†’ Connected via SAT 1, beam 30. Linked to GW (...:05, belongs to SAT 0).
- UT 8 â†’ Similar to UT 7, connected via SAT 1, beam 30 â†’ GW (...:05).
- ðŸ‘‰ Notice cross-links: UTs can connect to one satellite, but the serving GW may belong to another satellite (via ISL).

### 4. GW Users & UT Users
```
GW users
  GW user: ID = 14
  GW user: ID = 15
  GW user: ID = 16
UT users
  GW user: ID = 5
  GW user: ID = 6
  GW user: ID = 9
  GW user: ID = 10
  GW user: ID = 11
  GW user: ID = 12
```
- GW users (IDs 14â€“16) â†’ represent end-host applications behind the GWs.
- UT users (IDs 5â€“12) â†’ represent end-host applications behind the UTs.
- ðŸ‘‰ These IDs are not physical devices but logical application nodes.
==================
### 5. SatIdMapper (MAC â†’ Satellite ID)
```
SatIdMapper GW/UT MAC to satellite ID map
00:00:00:00:00:05 0
00:00:00:00:00:0b 0
00:00:00:00:00:0c 0
00:00:00:00:00:15 0
00:00:00:00:00:16 1
00:00:00:00:00:17 1
00:00:00:00:00:1a 1
```
- This table maps ground MAC addresses to which satellite (ID) they are associated with.
- Example:
  - `...:05` â†’ belongs to SAT 0.
  - `...:1a` â†’ belongs to SAT 1.
  - `...:0c` (UT 4) â†’ belongs to SAT 0.
