## Use a table to list important libraries and parameter definitions (Configuration). 
## Use a main program flow chart to explain the sequence between the program architecture and key functions. 
## Use a system architecture diagram to explain the important functional blocks and modules of the program. 
## Use a Message Sequence Chart (MSC) to explain the interactive behavior of important functional blocks and modules.
