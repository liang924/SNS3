### 4. GW Users & UT Users
```
GW users
  GW user: ID = 14
  GW user: ID = 15
  GW user: ID = 16
UT users
  GW user: ID = 5
  GW user: ID = 6
  GW user: ID = 9
  GW user: ID = 10
  GW user: ID = 11
  GW user: ID = 12
```
- GW users (IDs 14‚Äì16) ‚Üí represent end-host applications behind the GWs.
- UT users (IDs 5‚Äì12) ‚Üí represent end-host applications behind the UTs.
- üëâ These IDs are not physical devices but logical application nodes.

### 5. SatIdMapper (MAC ‚Üí Satellite ID)
```
SatIdMapper GW/UT MAC to satellite ID map
00:00:00:00:00:05 0
00:00:00:00:00:0b 0
00:00:00:00:00:0c 0
00:00:00:00:00:15 0
00:00:00:00:00:16 1
00:00:00:00:00:17 1
00:00:00:00:00:1a 1
```
- This table maps ground MAC addresses to which satellite (ID) they are associated with.
- Example:
  - `...:05` ‚Üí belongs to SAT 0.
  - `...:1a` ‚Üí belongs to SAT 1.
  - `...:0c` (UT 4) ‚Üí belongs to SAT 0.

**Output :** Internal Trace
### 1. Old Frame Handling and Release
```
+5.960551104s SatBbFrame:GetPayload(0x5e8f6e0527f0)
+5.960551104s SatBbFrame:GetPayload(0x5e8f6e0527f0)
+5.960551104s SatBbFrame:~SatBbFrame(0x5e8f6e0527f0)
```

- Action: The scheduler retrieves the payload (`GetPayload`) to pass it to the PHY/MAC layer for transmission.
- Destructor (`~SatBbFrame`): Indicates the frame is no longer needed, and memory is released.
- Meaning: The forward link transmission cycle finishes for this frame, and the system prepares for the next scheduling round.

### 2. New Scheduling Round Begins
```
+5.973331392s SatFwdLinkScheduler:SortSchedulingObjects(0x5e8f634c5f00)
+5.973331392s SatFwdLinkScheduler:GetSchedulingObjectCno(0x5e8f634c5f00, 0x5e8f6cdede80)
```

- SortSchedulingObjects: Orders all candidate scheduling objects (users/flows).
- GetSchedulingObjectCno: Fetches C/N‚ÇÄ (Carrier-to-Noise density ratio), representing channel quality for each object.
- Meaning: This step decides who gets served first, usually based on channel quality (CQI) or fairness criteria.

### 3. Frame Space Check and Payload Filling
```
+5.973331392s SatBbFrame:GetSpaceUsedInBytes(0x5e8f6de91b50)
+5.973331392s SatBbFrame:AddPayload(0x5e8f6de91b50)
+5.973331392s SatBbFrame:GetSpaceLeftInBytes(0x5e8f6de91b50)
```

- GetSpaceUsedInBytes: Checks how much of the BBFrame is already occupied.
- AddPayload: Places a user‚Äôs packet into the frame.
- GetSpaceLeftInBytes: Updates the remaining capacity.
- Meaning: The scheduler translates the scheduling decision into an actual physical transmission unit (BBFrame).

### 4. Full Scheduling Cycle

A single Forward Link Scheduling cycle follows these steps:

1. Frame cleanup ‚Üí old BBFrame payload is transmitted and freed.
2. Scheduling order ‚Üí sort users/flows based on C/N‚ÇÄ or policy.
3. Payload filling ‚Üí selected users‚Äô packets are added to the new BBFrame.
4. Capacity check ‚Üí repeat until the frame is full or time expires.
5. Frame dispatch ‚Üí completed BBFrame is sent, then cycle restarts.

### 5.Repeated Calls (Simplification)

- Multiple calls to GetPayload() ‚Üí due to upper/lower layers accessing payload.
- Multiple calls to GetSpaceUsedInBytes() ‚Üí triggered each time a packet is inserted.
- These can be summarized as ‚ÄúFrame check ‚Üí payload insertion ‚Üí update status.‚Äù

[BBFrameTx] Time: 9.99912, Frame Type: NORMAL_FRAME, ModCod: QPSK_1_TO_2, Occupancy: 1, Duration: +3.19507e+06ns, Space used: 4050, Space Left: 0 [Receivers: 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17, 00:00:00:00:00:17]
```
- Time: 9.99912
  Simulation time in seconds. This BB frame was transmitted at approximately t ‚âà 9.99912 s.

- Frame Type: NORMAL_FRAME
  The BB frame is a Normal frame under DVB-S2/S2X (not Short or Dummy).

- ModCod: QPSK_1_TO_2
  Modulation and coding scheme: QPSK with code rate 1/2.
  This determines the frame‚Äôs payload capacity and duration (looked up by SatBbFrameConf based on ModCod + FrameType).

- Occupancy: 1
  Occupancy = 1.0, meaning the frame is completely filled (no remaining space).

- Duration: +3.19507e+06 ns
  Frame duration ‚âà 3.19507 ms.
  This is derived from `GetBbFrameDuration`(modcod, type).

- Space used: 4050 B, Space Left: 0 B
  The frame payload carried 4050 bytes in total, with no remaining capacity (consistent with Occupancy = 1).

- Receivers: 00:00:00:00:00:17 (repeated multiple times)
  The frame contained multiple PDUs/packets, all directed to the same receiver MAC.
  In your topology dump earlier, 00:00:00:00:00:17 corresponds to UT ID = 8 (satellite 1, beam 30, linked to GW 00:...:05).
  So this frame is unicast to one UT, just carrying multiple packets for that single user.
