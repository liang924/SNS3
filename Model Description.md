### SatNetDevice
- The **main container module** that integrates submodules such as LLC, MAC, and PHY.
- Inherits from `NetDevice`, tailored for satellite use.


### SatPacketClassifier
- The **packet classifier** module.
- Classifies packets based on features (e.g., QoS, destination) to determine handling paths (e.g., queues or modules).


### SatUtLlc (Logical Link Control - LLC Layer)
- **SatReturnLinkEncapsulator**: Encapsulates uplink IP packets using Return Link Encapsulation (RLE) format for return channel transmission.
- **SatGenericStreamEncapsulator**: Handles downstream packet unpacking and re-encapsulation.
- **SatQueue**: Temporary buffers for uplink and downlink data.
- **SatRequestManager**: 
  - Monitors queue status and length.
  - Sends **Capacity Request (CR)** messages to the **Network Control Center (NCC)** when needed.
  - Supports two types of dynamic capacity requests:
    - **RBDC** (Rate-Based Dynamic Capacity)
    - **VBDC** (Volume-Based Dynamic Capacity)

### SatUtMac (MAC Layer)
- **SatUtScheduler**: Schedules time slots based on TBTP (Terminal Burst Time Plan) information.
- **SatRandomAccess**: Supports random access mechanisms.
- **SatTbtpContainer**: Stores TBTP content received from NCC.

### Typical Usage Flow

1. Packets enter the UT and are classified by `SatPacketClassifier`.
2. LLC layer processes uplink/downlink encapsulation and manages queues.
3. `SatRequestManager` sends CR messages to the NCC based on queue status.
4. MAC layer uses TBTP to schedule transmissions.
5. PHY layer executes actual transmission and reception of packets, including interference assessment.

### 1. SatGeoUserPhy
Handles the **User Link PHY layer** for communication with end-users.

- `Tx`: Transmitter module responsible for sending signals to the user terminal (UE).
- `Rx`: Receiver module to receive signals from the user terminal.
- `RxC`: Receiver Control module that monitors the quality of reception.
- `I`: Interference Estimator used to calculate SINR (Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio).

### 2. SatGeoFeederPhy
Handles the **Feeder Link PHY layer**, typically used for communication with the ground gateway (GW).

- Structure is similar to `SatGeoUserPhy`, including `Tx`, `Rx`, `RxC`, and `I`.
- Responsible for receiving signals from the GW or sending signals back to it.

### Additional Notes

- **Transparent Forwarding (bent-pipe)**:  
  The satellite does not process any packets; it only amplifies and forwards the signal.

- **SINR Calculation**:  
  Although the satellite does not process packets, it still calculates SINR. This is done **separately** at both the user and feeder ends and then **combined** at the final receiver (e.g., the gateway) using a composite formula.

- **No Processing Logic**:  
  No packet segmentation or reassembly is performed; only analog signal-level operations are involved.

- The **LLC layer** supports bidirectional operations via separate **Tx** and **Rx** modules, ensuring full-duplex communication.
- The **MAC layer** is responsible for generating BBFrames based on a MODCOD scheme and scheduling them efficiently.
- The **PHY layer** provides both transmission and multi-carrier reception functionality and supports:
  - Link quality monitoring
  - Interference assessment
- Even when no user data is available, the Gateway can generate **dummy BBFrames** to maintain synchronization and continuous frame transmission.
